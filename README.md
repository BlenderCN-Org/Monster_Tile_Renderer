Monster Tile Renderer
====

I wrote a short wiki about usage and tips for Monster Renderer.
[Monster Tile Renderer - Info sheet](https://github.com/zeffii/Monster_Tile_Renderer/wiki/Monster-Tile-Renderer---Info-sheet.)
If you are new to tile/region rendering then please read it before using it. It's short and covers everything that i could think of.


###  Considerations for future releases.  
: I've already written code to the effect of being able to email an image from blender to my gmail account.  
: I will try to find this .py and upload here, and consider adding things like  
: - option to either email upon tile completion  
: - email upon tile completion and email the image at the same time  
: - email upon tile completion, but don't email the images  (or thumbnail )  
: - email upon tile completion, but don't email the images, email a reduced version of the composite (so you know what's going on)
